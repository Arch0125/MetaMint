# MetaMint
- MetaMint leverages the power of NFT Minting to create subscriptions based NFT launches. MOst of the creators have to go through the hussle of minting NFTs anf then listing on OpenSea or any other NFT marketplace. To solve this inefficiency MetaMint provides a simple Drag and Dropp interface for the creator to create dynamic NFT listings. 
- Further the creator can enable subscription based NFT launches, which means users can opt for subscriptions to gain access to unminted NFsTs before they are minted by the user. This helps the user to create a better interactive fanbase and also a better stream of income from NFTs.
- Because of minting the dual transfer of ownership is eliminated how ever the unique identity is maintained since the IPFS meta-data contains the details of the address from where the NFT was minted, i.e. the creators website. Hence MetaMint improves the overall journey of an NFT.

## How MetaMint works
1. The creator uploads a folder/file in IPFS through our API
2. The IPFS hash and metadata is stored in the smart-contract
3. Creator can now launch the NFT list
4. The NFTs are currently hidden and left to be minted by the buyers
5. Once minted the subscription fee is transferred to the NFT owner
6. The ownership is transferred to the minter

## Some Unique Features of MetaMint
1. Upload a Folder of images at once instead of single images
2. Create a unrevealed NFT launch, where NFTs will be revealed after all of them are minted
3. Change Subscription fees at any point of time
